# Implementation Plan: Migrating Unresolved Excel Comments
Reference: Parent Issue #5

# ðŸŽ‰ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE** (September 28, 2025)

## âœ… **Successfully Implemented Features**

**Core Migration Types:**
- **Exact Match Migration**: âœ… Comments migrate to identical OpenAPI anchors  
- **Type A (NoAnchor) Migration**: âœ… Comments without anchors migrate to nearest `/TitleRow` heading
- **Type B (NoWorksheet) Migration**: âœ… Comments from missing worksheets migrate to Info sheet column V

**Technical Implementation:**
- **CustomXML OpenAPI Mapping**: âœ… Full cell-to-OpenAPI entity mapping system
- **Hybrid Comment Architecture**: âœ… Legacy+ThreadedComment approach for maximum compatibility
- **Thread Preservation**: âœ… Parent-child comment relationships maintained across all migration types
- **Collision Handling**: âœ… Smart placement with fallback strategies for occupied cells
- **Integration**: âœ… Seamless integration with existing workbook generation pipeline

**Testing & Validation:**
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: âœ… 12/12 tests passing covering all migration scenarios
- **Manual Validation**: âœ… User-confirmed visual verification of threaded comments with replies
- **CI/CD Integration**: âœ… All tests passing in automated build pipeline

**Note:** This implementation will use the ClosedXML library for all Excel operations. Only modern threaded comments are supported; legacy (non-threaded) comments will not be migrated.


## 1. Identifying and Extracting Unresolved Comments
- Use the ClosedXML .NET library to read both old and new Excel workbooks.
- Iterate through all worksheets, cells, and threaded comments in the old workbook.
- For each threaded comment, check if it is unresolved.
- Extract:
  - Worksheet name
  - Cell address
  - Comment text
  - Author
  - Thread/conversation metadata (if available)

**See also:** [docs/custom-xml-metadata-mapping.md](custom-xml-metadata-mapping.md) for details on how to map cells to OpenAPI entities using Custom XML parts.

## 2. Matching Comments to Relevant Sections in the New Workbook
- Determine the logical "anchor" for each comment (e.g., operationId, parameter name, schema property).
- If possible, encode a hidden mapping or metadata in the workbook linking each cell to its OpenAPI entity.
- In the new workbook, use the same logic to map cells to OpenAPI entities.
- Match old comments to new cells by comparing these anchors, not just cell addresses.
- If no direct match, flag for manual review.

**See also:** [docs/custom-xml-metadata-mapping.md](custom-xml-metadata-mapping.md) for recommended anchor syntax and metadata structure.

## 3. Handling Conflicts, Missing References, or Structure Changes
- **Missing References**: If a comment's anchor no longer exists, collect for reporting.
- **Conflicts**: If a cell in the new workbook already has a comment:
  - Merge comments (append old to new, with attribution)
  - Keep both as separate threads (if supported)
  - Flag for manual resolution
- **Structure Changes**: If layout changes significantly, fallback to fuzzy matching (e.g., by operation summary, parameter name, or property path).

## 3A. Handling Non-Migratable Comments (Types A & B) âœ… **COMPLETED**

### Type A: "NoAnchor" Comments âœ… **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
Comments found on worksheets that exist in the new workbook but are located on rows without OpenAPI anchors:
- **Migration Strategy**: âœ… Migrates to the same worksheet, preserving the original column
- **Row Placement**: âœ… Finds the nearest row above that contains an anchor ending with `/TitleRow` (heading row)
- **Collision Handling**: âœ… If target cell has content/comments, places in the row below the heading row
- **Full Thread Migration**: âœ… Migrates complete comment threads (root + replies) using the established Legacy + ThreadedComment approach

### Type B: "NoWorksheet" Comments âœ… **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**
Comments found on worksheets that will not exist in the new workbook:
- **Migration Strategy**: âœ… Migrates to the Info sheet (identified by `OpenApiDocumentationLanguageConst.Info`)
- **Placement**: âœ… Column V, starting at row 1, stacking downward for subsequent comments
- **Full Thread Migration**: âœ… Preserves complete comment threads as threaded comments
- **Metadata Preservation**: âœ… Includes reference to original worksheet name in comment context
- **Dual Interception**: âœ… Intercepts both worksheet selection (â†’ Info) and cell placement (â†’ column V)

## 4. Integrating the Old Workbook as an Input
- Update CLI/API to accept an optional "previous workbook" input parameter.
- Processing flow:
  1. Load old workbook and extract unresolved comments.
  2. Generate new workbook from updated OpenAPI spec.
  3. Before saving new workbook, inject migrated comments into appropriate locations.

## 5. Tools, Libraries, and APIs
- **ClosedXML**: High-level .NET library for Excel, supports threaded comments (required for this feature).
- **Diff/Merge Libraries**: For fuzzy matching or diffing OpenAPI entities.
- **Custom XML Metadata Mapping**: See [docs/custom-xml-metadata-mapping.md](custom-xml-metadata-mapping.md) for implementation details and rationale for using Custom XML parts for cell-to-OpenAPI mapping.

## 6. Risks, Edge Cases, and Testability
- **Risks**:
  - Major spec changes may make matching unreliable.
  - Comments on deleted/renamed entities may be orphaned.
  - Threaded comments or advanced Excel features may not be fully supported.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Multiple comments per cell.
  - Comments on merged cells or non-standard layouts.
  - Comments on summary/info sheets.
- **Testability**:
  - See [docs/unit-testing-policy-migrate-comments.md](unit-testing-policy-migrate-comments.md) for the behavioral test outline and test artefact strategy.
  - Create test cases with various workbook versions and comment scenarios.
  - Validate all unresolved comments are migrated or reported as unmigratable.
  - Ensure no data loss or corruption in the new workbook.

## 7. Potential Blockers / Open Questions
1. How are OpenAPI entities currently mapped to Excel cells? Is there a stable anchor for matching?
2. Are there any remaining legacy (non-threaded) comments in use? 
  - **Answer:** No. Legacy (non-threaded) comments will not be supported or migrated. Only modern threaded comments are in scope.
3. Is there a requirement to preserve comment authorship and timestamps?
  - **Answer:** Yes. Preserving the stakeholder (author) and timestamp is important context when reading a comment and will be supported in the migration process.
4. Should the tool support partial/fuzzy matches, or only exact matches?
  - **Answer:** Only exact matches will be supported in the first iteration to keep the feature simple. A future enhancement request may add fuzzy/partial matching. As a backup, if an exact match is not found, the tool may attempt a case-insensitive and special-character-insensitive comparison. If no match is found, the comment will be considered unmigratable.
